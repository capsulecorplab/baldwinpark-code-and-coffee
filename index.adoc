== Introduction
Welcome to the Code & Coffee Compendium GitHub repository! Maintained by the Baldwin Park study group, this page serves as a resource compendium for facilitating frequently asked questions from our meetup events. If you have any requests for particular resources, or would like to add one, please feel free to submit a https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/code-coffee-compendium/issues/new[new issue] or create a https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork[pull request]!

Note: this README is written in the AsciiDoc markup language (see https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference[AsciiDoc Syntax Quick Reference]).
